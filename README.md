# Humanode Report
Growth of humanode validators keeping perfect uptime of 84 epochs has being on the increased since early July to the last report.  696 validators maintained perfect uptime (i.e active throughout the period) during the last 84 epochs representing 46.46% of the total validators who participated in the epochs. This is a  14.7 percent increase from the last bi- weekly measurement. A total of 1498 unique humanodes participated in the epoch period under-review. This increase in perfect uptime validators is a strong signal that the chain is growing to become more reliable, decentralized and secure, as security in the blockchain space in most cases are measured relative to chain decentralization. A total of 121154.86 units of humanode token with  market value of $11025 at 0.091USDT (as of the official time of distribution)  per unit were distributed to these participants to incentivize them of their services.
Table 1 shows the summary of findings for this current epoch period i.e Epoch 3854-3937
### Brief explanation of the columns of table 1
- **Epochs:** Uptime which range from 84 to 1
- **Uptime:** number of addresses that were active for each epoch period eg 696 addresses were active for 84 epochs period
- **% TUs:**  uptime percentage out of total participated addresses e.g the 696 addresses that had perfect epoch form 46.46% of the total participated addresses
- **Rewards:** Total rewards in Humanode native token distributed for each attained epoch
- **% TDR:** percentage of the reward distributed for each epoch out of the total distributed rewards of 121154.86 units of humanode token

## Broader Review.
From the beginning of July to the last report, they have being a total of 2986 humanodes that participated in validating and securing transactions in the blockchain. Out of this number, 838 humanodes representing 28.06% of these addresses have participated concurrently in the program, of which 318 of these addresses maintained perfect uptime throughout the said periods; These concurrent addresses form 96.95% of the  participated addresses who had perfect uptime of 84 epochs in epoch_3518-3601, 97.17% of epoch_3602-3685, 80.17% of epoch_3686-3769, 68.99% of epoch_3770-3853, 56.61% of epoch_3854-3937
Also since Epoch_3518 to date, number of addresses that attained perfect epoch i.e 84 epochs per period has being on the increase steadily.
Table2 depicts the summary of my findings.
#### Brief explanation of Table2 columns and what they represent are given below.
- **Epochs:** Represent bi-weekly periods 
- **% CAC** Contributions of concurrent addresses to perfect epochs ( perfect epochs means addresses that had 84 epochs) e.g 96.95% of the total addresses that had 84 epochs in epoch3518-3601 are among the consistents addresses that participated in the program since early July
- **TPE** Total number of addresses that had 84 epoch uptime in each period 
- **% TPE:** Percentage of the addresses that had 84 epoch uptime out of the total addresses that participated in the epoch period 
- **TPE2:** Total number of addresses that had at least 83 epoch uptime
- **% TPE2:** Percentage of addresses that had at least 83 epoch uptime of the total addresses that participated in the epoch period
- **TPA:** Total number addresses that participated in the epoch period 
- **R_HMND:** Total humanode token distributed to validators to incentivize them of their service for each period
